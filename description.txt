This is me,
raw, uncut, unfilltered me.
How you see the world and 
how you show yourself to the world,
They both express who you are,
It makes a statement,
Be it home or away,
Serendipitous or expected,
A stranger,
Or the one you love,
Your images are a celebration of your point of view,
Your own uniqueness,
Embrace each trial and error,
That way,Instead of following the others,
You are creating your own path,
It's more than just finding a unique moment,
It's a richer process,
Full of inspiration,
The feeling of satisfaction and pride in making each of those moments more deeply,
Your,You can go beyond limits and do your creative voice more justice,
Creativity means there are no wrong answers,
There's just you expressing what's important,
Your passion,Your style,Your voice to be truly iconic
make iconic.
